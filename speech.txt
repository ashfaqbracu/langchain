Bangladesh's lower-middle income mixed-market economy is among the fastest growing economies in the world.[201][202] A rapidly developing country, it has the world's 36th-largest economy by nominal terms, and the 24th-largest by PPP. Bangladesh has a labour force of 71.4 million,[203] which is the world's seventh-largest; with an unemployment rate of 5.1% as of 2023.[204] Its foreign exchange reserves, although depleting,[205] remain the second-highest in South Asia, after India. Bangladesh's large diaspora contributed roughly $27 billion in remittances in 2024.[206] The Bangladeshi taka is the national currency.

As of 2023, the large service sector accounts for about 51.5% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (34.6%), while the agriculture sector is by far the smallest, making up only 11% of total GDP;[9] despite being the largest employment sector, providing roughly half of the total workforce.[207] Over 84% of the export earnings come from the textile industry.[208] Bangladesh is the second-leading garments exporter in the world, and plays a crucial role in the global fast fashion industry, exporting to various Western fashion brands.[209] It is also a major producer of jute,[210] rice,[211] fish,[212] tea,[213] and flowers.[214] Other major industries include shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, steel, electronics and leather goods.[215] China is the largest trading partner of Bangladesh, accounting for 15% of the total trade, followed by India; which accounts for 8% of the total trade.[216]

The private sector accounts for 80% of GDP compared to the dwindling role of state-owned companies.[217] Bangladesh's economy is dominated by family-owned conglomerates and small and medium-sized businesses. Some of the largest publicly traded companies in Bangladesh include BEXIMCO, BRAC Bank, BSRM, GPH Ispat, Grameenphone, Summit Group, and Square Pharmaceuticals.[218] The Dhaka and Chittagong Stock Exchanges are the country's twin capital markets.[219] Its telecommunications industry is one of the world's fastest growing, with 188.78 million cellphone subscribers at the end of November 2024.[220] Political instability,[221] high inflation,[222] endemic corruption,[223] insufficient power supplies,[224] and slow implementation of reforms are major challenges to economic growth.[222]

Bangladesh, a country experiencing daily blackouts several times a day in 2009, achieved 100% electrification by 2022.[225][226] It is gradually transitioning to a green economy and has the largest off-grid solar power programme in the world, benefiting 20 million people.[227] An electric car called the Palki is being developed for production in the country.[228] Biogas is being used to produce organic fertiliser.[229] The under-construction Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, under-construction with assistance from the Russian company Rosatom, will be the first operational nuclear power plant in the country. Its first unit, out of the two total units, is expected to go into operation in 2025.[230]

Bangladesh continues to have huge untapped reserves of natural gas, particularly in its maritime territory.[231][232] A lack of exploration and decreasing proven reserves have forced Bangladesh to import LNG from abroad.[233][234][235] Gas shortages were further exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[236] Bangladesh stopped buying spot price LNG temporarily in July 2022, despite constant load-shedding, due to a steep price hike in the global market.[237] It restarted buying spot price LNG once again in February 2023 as prices eased.[238]

While government-owned companies in Bangladesh generate nearly half of Bangladesh's electricity, privately owned companies like the Summit Group and Orion Group are playing an increasingly important role in both generating electricity, and supplying machinery, reactors, and equipment.[239] Bangladesh increased electricity production capacity from 5 gigawatts in 2009 to 25.5 gigawatts in 2022. It plans to further increase it to 50 gigawatts by 2041. US companies like Chevron and General Electric supply around 55% of Bangladesh's domestic natural gas production and are among the largest investors in power projects. 80% of Bangladesh's installed gas-fired power generation capacity comes from turbines manufactured in the United States.[240]

The tourism industry is expanding, contributing some 3.02% of total GDP.[241] Bangladesh's international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $391 million.[242] The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites (the Mosque City, the Buddhist Vihara and the Sundarbans) and seven tentative-list sites.[243] The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) reported in 2019 that the travel and tourism industry in Bangladesh directly generated 1,180,500 jobs in 2018 or 1.9% of the country's total employment.[244] According to the same report, Bangladesh experiences around 125,000 international tourist arrivals per year.[244] Domestic spending generated 97.7 per cent of direct travel and tourism gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012.[245]

Bangladesh had a recorded population of 169.8 million in the 2022 census,[11] which rose to 171.4 million as of 2023.[10] It is the eighth-most-populous country in the world, the fifth-most populous country in Asia, and the most densely populated large country in the world, with a headline population density of 1,265 people/km2 as of 2020.[247] Bangladesh's total fertility rate (TFR), once among the highest in the world, has experienced a dramatic decline, from 5.5 in 1985 to 3.7 in 1995, down to 1.9 in 2022,[248] which is below the sub-replacement fertility of 2.1.[249] Most of the population live in rural areas, with only 40% of the population living in urban areas as of 2023.[250] Bangladesh has a median age of roughly 28 years, with 26% of the total population aged 14 or younger,[251] and merely 6% aged 65 and above as of 2023.[252]

Bangladesh is an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society, as Bengalis form 99% of the population.[9] The Adivasi population includes the Chakmas, Marmas, Santhals, Mros, Tanchangyas, Bawms, Tripuris, Khasis, Khumis, Kukis, Garos, and Bisnupriya Manipuris. The Chittagong Hill Tracts region experienced unrest and an insurgency from 1975 to 1997 in an autonomy movement by its indigenous people. Although a peace accord was signed in 1997, the region remains militarised.[253] Urdu-speaking stranded Pakistanis were given citizenship by the Supreme Court in 2008.[254] Bangladesh also hosts over 700,000 Rohingya refugees since 2017, giving it one of the largest refugee populations in the world.[138]
